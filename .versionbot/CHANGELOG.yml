      body: |
        This makes the test run check more robust and handles
        cases where we may see unexpected results like more or
        fewer test runs with varying conclusions.

        Github script is also more secure and less prone
        to string processing issues than bash CLI commands.

      hash: edc051f80d18b6969f3a2d7bac7a5520ea6fb2c5
      body: |
        The action currently has dependencies on the leviathan base
        project so we need to keep them aligned for now.

        If a future revision of the action performs it's own fetch of
        leviathan, we would revert this change.

      hash: 642f6faa706f308a328e0a68e1da0e7b2d16ea22
      body: >
        On PRs if there are no deflate files generated, the subsequent encrypt
        step will fail (it is run only for private DTs). Rather than add any
        further complication to that step, its cleaner to just prepare the
        deflate files regardless. Especially as we might be adding them to PR
        draft releases in the future anyway. The time cost is low for this step
        anyway.

        - Replace single 'Upload artifacts' with separate uploads for hostapp
        and testing


        - Hostapp artifacts include deflate files, manifests, and metadata for
        S3/webresource deployment


        - Testing artifacts include images and docker containers needed by
        Leviathan test suites


        - Use specific file patterns instead of tarball for better separation of
        concerns

        If something failed on S3 upload, we do not want to deploy the
        hostapp as it will likely need to be invalidated.

        This order will change when we move to web resources, and uploads
        depend on the hostapp creation.

      body: |
        Commit 8d9f26fb switched to using the wildcard * char inside quotes,
        which makes ls fail to find the intended directory and thus all builds
        for older Poky revisions fail. We can fix this by removing the quotes.

        This is for use in at least 3 device types - where the customer requires
        a non-flasher image to be available by default via downloads, but for
        testing purposes we need ot use the flasher image. This change allows
        for selecting the flasher image using the test_matrix input - i.e image:

        The AWS environment is always tied to the balenaCloud deploy
        environment so exposing this to the device workflows is only
        potential for issues, and no benefit.

        For the time being, the deploy environment will contain
        both the AWS and BC vars and secrets.

        environments to all the repositories.

        This allows more granular control over which environments are used
        for which steps, and avoids requiring a single environment to define
        how to build, sign, and publish.

        This is better for security as it allows each job to only have
        the secrets it needs, and not all secrets for all steps.

        We retain backwards compatibility by falling back to the original
        monolith environment input for now.

        commit allows to specify which layer to look the sample templates from.

      hash: cad0b71d6a2b26ff90d6ae5b0f8247c4b3237479
      body: |
        Secure boots builds used to end up with a mismatch between the kernel
        and modules signatures because of the use of cache - to avoid this we
        temporarily forced builds without cache.

        With the fix in meta-balena 389054e84c0b1fd382d737c39fb2bb02c2b3e9b2,
        kernel modules are always set not to use cache and this problem should
        no longer happen.

        At least during the i.MX secure boot local builds with cache never hit
        the problem.

        Remove the setting not to use cache.

      hash: 345cdbbf64575fc39bca4251353e823e1bcec741
      body: |
        For the first deployment of the S3 download mirror we will
        err on the side of cost savings, and use the mirror as a
        fallback not the primary source of downloads.

        Revert this if we want the benefits of using our own mirrors
        as the primary source, like download speed and no rate limits.

        This change makes the legacy NFS cache mount
        optional, and will not fail the build if unset
        or unreachable.

        Instead, if the NFS is available it will be used
        as a read-only mirror for shared downloads,
        but will not be updated with new files.

        The existing method of using labels allows for

        because we do not associate the label with any commit.

        This action requires approvals via reactions on a unique
        comment generated for each workflow run.

      hash: 922d1dd1e09c74e393962069bdac0ce69c17e9cb
      body: |
        Some device types (generic-armd64) need to run the test
        suites twice for the same base image, once with secure boot
        vars enabled in Leviathan, and once without.

        Rather than run the suites in series, or require building the
        image twice, we can allow the test matrix to define separate runs
        for the two modes.

        When evaluating expressions for cancel-in-progress, certain
        parameters may not be available at the time of evaluation.

        For instance, the github.job context is not accessible, as it's
        specific to the running job and not the concurrency group.

        We currently have many `8cpu` runners available that are

        migrating from Jenkins that we should allow to use for yocto builds.


        As long as some runners don't have the `yocto` tag so we don't
        bottleneck the runner queue for other orgs.

    - subject: Add unique unique identifiers to summary job
      hash: 625a45b652c332ec5d048caeee7dc25638df8dfb
      body: |
        The "All jobs" job is used for branch protection
        as it captures the overall success/fail of all
        the test matrices and build.

        However without a unique name we are unable
        to identify the device type in order to mark it as required.

        This change adds a single instance matrix
        to the build job and as a result will append the machine
        name and deploy environment in the job name.

        mixed a test for string length with a test for string equality.

        The include syntax allows full control over settings used
        in each test job, but the combinatorial is simpler to write

        Rather than force one, we can allow both and default to the simple
        syntax.

        Marking as minor since the input syntax has changed, but isn't
        currently used in production anywhere.

      hash: 872bb3b1df920b026b524e041bf4f4f7c422cb2f
      body: |
        When a ESR release is deployed a tag with the base meta-balena version
        is created. This is used by the API to check for a valid OS version
        for updates.

        The current mechanism to find the base version only provides an ESR
        version for the first commit after the branch has been created.

        Using merge-base to find the common ancestor and `tag --points-at` to
        find the actual tag works for all commits after the branch is created.

    - subject: Support commit tags when extracting version tag from git
      hash: 98fec51fae4721224e64cfec52480a5f17b8e271
      body: >
        Git describe does not include commit tags by default, and only annotated
        tags are shown.


        This behaviour was fine until a recent CI issue changed the types of
        tags used to version the repositories.


        This commit allows supporting of both types while the CI issue is
        investigated.

        Yocto already splits the build sstate by target arch, native arch,
        toolchains, and machine where applicable.


        Keeping the caches separated by device type prevents sharing of common
        cache steps between identical toolchains and architectures.

      hash: 8855ad4d31b45187e4007763b6bb084e08974807
      body: |
        When parsing additional variables to be passed to the bitbake build,
        keys and values are split using equals as a delimiter. However, the
        splitting process does not split only on the first occurrence, which
        results in removing equals signs from the value as well. This is
        problematic with base64 encoded strings, which are padded with equals
        signs.

        Split only on the first occurrence, leaving the value intact.

        version

        will be a proper semver.

        Separating the build and release of blocks allows to use common code for

        block release.


        Also, pass a flag to specify whether the block should be deployed as
        final

        release.

        The previous commit moved the preloaded image out of yocto cache, which

        This patch makes mktemp create the file back within yocto cache to
        ensure

        this is shared yet still each concurrent process can safely have its own
        copy.

        Since the file name is hardcoded at this moment, this fails when two

        builds are running in parallel (e.g. dev and prod variants during
        deploy)

        because they try to preload the same file at pretty much the same
        moment.

        Having a separate copy for each outside of yocto cache should fix the
        issue.

        Currently we are reading a package list from the contracts that mixes

        recipe and package names, and we run bitbake with the `-k` flag not to

        stop the build when a package name fails to match a recipe.


        The contracts have now been modified to specify either a
        `sw.recipe.yocto`

        or a `sw.package.yocto` so we can distinguish between them and use

        recipe names to build and package names to install.


        We also remove the continue flag from bitbake.

      body: >-
        When running multiple daemons, we don't want them to clash managing

        iptables so we start redundant daemons with iptables and ipmasq set to

        false.

        By default we enable both which is the current dockerd default.

        When running a single docker daemon without the iptables and ipmasq
        flags,

        containers on the default bridge network cannot communite with the

        outside as no iptables rules are set.

      body: |-
        Setting `--supervisor-tag` to enable building for a specific supervisor
        tag sets the `SUPERVISOR_TAG` value. That is the correct variable
        to set according to meta-balena (see at https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/blob/8d5057b45e1965e6c27c03a95d2211ae47842331/meta-balena-common/recipes-containers/resin-supervisor/resin-supervisor.inc#L20 )
        but in the device types' `local.conf.sample` the `TARGET_TAG` variable
        was set, see for example https://github.com/balena-os/balena-raspberrypi/blob/078b0add0345e94f27c15d98256f8c7b61b66761/layers/meta-balena-raspberrypi/conf/samples/local.conf.sample#L45-L46
        and thus barys' setting was not applied.
        Looking at the available recipes, the `SUPERVISOR_TAG` should be set
        and in the device types' `local.conf.example` files should be updated
        to refer to that instead of `TARGET_TAG`.
        With this change this can be implemented in two steps:
        * the current PR updates `SUPERVISOR_TAG` if exists or appends if it doesn't (or the
        update has failed) in local.conf and allows using the relevant barys flag again
        * in other per-device repo PRs then the `local.conf.example` can separately updated,
        to be less misleading, on its own schedule

        Since s4cmd does not have the "--acl-public" option we use the new
        --API-ACL option that allows us to set canned ACLs for the objects
        we upload to S3. We use the "public-read" canned ACL that does:
        "Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ access."
        Also we remove the "--skip-existing" option which is not present
        in s4cmd.

        Instead it provides a replacement package called s4cmd
        (https://packages.debian.org/buster/s4cmd) which "is intended as
        an alternative to the existing s3cmd tool, enhancing performance
        and support for large files, and coming with a number of additional

        build. For various reasons related to the Jenkins environment and not

        can fail. If the second, third or fourth of these builds fail, when
        retriggering the upstream

        Jenkins job to redo the deployment it will error out on the code
        highlighted here complaining that

        deployment is done. That should not be an error and it should only throw
        a warning and continue with

        the rest of the downstream build jobs to finish deploying successfully
        all the resin build flavours.

        Also install nodejs v4 and npm v3 instead of the
        much outdated versions from the standard Ubuntu repositories.

        We create two groups right now: one for docker and one for the

        user running the script (to avoid any permission issues). The docker
        group

        is created without specifying the GID so it will take the first
        available one

        (in container that is 1000). The user GID can be anything from 1000 up.

        If the user has GID 1000 and we first create docker group (this will
        take 1000)

        and then the user group (1000), we will get an error. Avoid this by
        creating

        the current user group first and then the docker one.
