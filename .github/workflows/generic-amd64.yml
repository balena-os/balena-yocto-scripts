# This is an approximate example of a single Yocto device-type workflow

# It will be duplicated across all device repos with only minor changes

  # With these triggers the Yocto jobs will run
  # in parallel with the Flowzone jobs, which is fine for now
  # and allows us to better control what we want to test and when.
  # It is expected that Flowzone could fail, but yocto jobs will run.
